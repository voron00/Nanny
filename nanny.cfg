#                           IP Address

# This is the IP address of your CoD2 server.
# If, for some stupid reason, you dont know the IP of your own server,
#   you can determine your ip address by opening a web browser on your
#   CoD2 server and browsing to:  http://myip.isomedia.com/
#
# CHANGE THIS!

ip_address = 0.0.0.0


# =========================================================================

#                           Port Number

# The port number that your CoD2 server listens for connections on.
# The default port number for CoD2 is 28960

port = 28960


# =========================================================================

#                          RCON Password

# The rcon password is the administrative password for issuing commands
#   to your server in-gamve via the /rcon command.  The babysitter script
#   needs this password so that it can issue commands to your server.
#
# CHANGE THIS!

rcon_pass = 12345

# =========================================================================

#                             Logfile

# The path to the server_mp.log file.
# This is how the nannybot can see into what's happening in the game.
# Specify the path to the server logfile.  It can either be a windows
# or unix path name.

# Now, you can also run nanny on remote computers if the server allows
# FTP access to the server logfile.

# Examples of a running nanny on the machine as the CoD2 server:
# server_logfile = C:\Program Files\1C\Activision\Call of Duty 2\^2Jump\nannybot\games_mp.log
# server_logfile = /home/username/.callofduty2/main/server_mp.log
# server_logfile = C:\Program Files\1C\Activision\Call of Duty 2\^2Jump\nannybot\games_mp.log


#server_logfile = ftp://0.0.0.0/.callofduty2/main/games_mp.log

#                      !command access
#
#   Use this section to define who gets access to what !commands.
#   Access can be granted by IP, GUID number, or everybody or nobody.
#
# Follow this syntax:  auth_command = value
#   where command is the name of the !command
#   and where value is one of the following:
#
#       disabled  - this disables the command, nobody can run it.
#          Example:  auth_seen = disabled
#
#       everyone - this enables the command, everyone is allowed to use it.
#          Example:  auth_stats = everyone
#
#       a guid number - Define the exact GUID number. - If you don't know
#             your guid number, run the rcon status command, look for guid.
#             guid numbers are usually 6 or 7 digit numbers
#          Example:  auth_locate = 907568
#
#       an ip address - Define one IP address to allow.
#          Example:  auth_locate = 127.115.64.121
#
#       a wildcard IP address - Allows a range of IP's access to a command
#              this is usually handy for when you have a DHCP address from your ISP.
#          Example:  auth_locate = 66.114.146.*

#                           Anti Vote Rushing

# I added this because I got tired of the people with the fast computers
# calling votes at the begining of a level and getting their votes to
# pass before anybody else even had a chance to join.  When this feature
# is enabled, it will briefly turn voting off at the very begining of
# the level.  This gives more people a chance to join before votes are
# allowed to be called.

#                           Flood Protection
 
# This makes it so that you have to wait for a while between issuing !commands.  
# This is designed so that people can't tie the nannybot up for long periods of
# time by issueing lots of commands.  I had one user that would say !awards
# over and over and over again, and the nanny would take almost an HOUR to stop
# printing out awards.   No more.  If you try a command and it does nothing, it
# probably means that flood protection is stopping it.  Wait for a minute or two
# and try the command again.

# If you want users to be able to flood commands, you can disable this setting.

# I recommend that you leave this setting enabled.

# ==========================================================================

#                         GUID sanity checking. 

# This attempts to detect when the server is recording the wrong GUID number 
# for players.  When the server is "unsane" it will have bad data that will
# screw up the !aliases command AND may cause you to unintentionally ban the
# wrong people.  I have had MY OWN guid banned when banning other people.
# 
# I dont yet know if Windows-based servers have this problem.  So far I have
# only observed this problem on linux-based servers.
#
# Note: This feature will not work on "cracked" servers since all users have
#  GUID 0.  When GUID sanity checks fail, Restart the COD2 server and the 
#  nannybot to fix GUID sanity problems.

# If you dont want to use GUID sanity checking, you can disable it here.
